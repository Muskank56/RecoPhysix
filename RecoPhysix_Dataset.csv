advantage of being flexible. The study of the properties of such a bundle is an active field of research known as fiber
optics. A bundle may consist of thousand of individual fibers, each of the order of
0.002 to \( 0.01 \mathrm{mm} \) in diameter. If the fiber
can be assembled in the bundle so that
the relative positions of the ends are the same at both ends, the bundle can transmit an image as shown in Fig.(b) Bundles several km in length have been
made. Device using fiber optics are finding a wide range of applications in medical science. The interior of lungs
and other passage in the human body can be viewed by insertion of a fiber bundle that can be enclosed in a
